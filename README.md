Aggregation of Diverse Models: The Random Forest model amalgamates predictions from multiple decision trees, harnessing the collective expertise of various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. This comprehensive approach augments its predictive prowess and diminishes the risk of bias. Bias Reduction and Generalization: By consolidating predictions from diverse models, Random Forest mitigates bias and overfitting. It achieves a harmonious balance between bias and variance, culminating in a more universally applicable solution that excels in novel data scenarios. Robust Performance: Random Forest exhibits robust performance across an array of evaluation metrics, deftly navigating the delicate trade-off between precision and recall. Its ensemble methodology engenders stability and dependability in predictions, rendering it a stalwart choice for employee turnover prognostication.
